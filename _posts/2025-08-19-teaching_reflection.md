# Teaching Tic Tac Toe in Jupyter: A fundamental concept

When we taught Tic Tac Toe, the real focus wasn’t just on the game itself—it was on showing how CSSE students can use **Jupyter Notebooks** to combine code, notes, and output in one place. Tic Tac Toe became our example project, but the real lesson was learning how to navigate the notebook environment and think like a programmer.

We introduced the basics:

* **Raw cells** for frontmatter and metadata
* **Markdown cells** for writing instructions and explanations
* **Code cells** for running Python step by step

Using Tic Tac Toe, we gave a practical example of how these cell types work together. Students got to see how a board could be stored in a Python list, how functions help organize code, and how running cells lets you test ideas one piece at a time. Instead of just reading theory, they could actually *play* with the code, change values, and instantly see the results.

For beginners, this project worked really well because Tic Tac Toe is familiar and simple. There’s no need to explain complex game rules—the focus stays on learning the notebook interface and understanding the programming logic behind the moves.

Reflecting on it, teaching this way reminded us how effective Jupyter is as a learning tool. By weaving together explanations and code in one document, we weren’t just teaching Python—we were teaching **how to learn coding interactively**. Tic Tac Toe was the hook, but the real takeaway was confidence in using Jupyter as a space for experimentation.
