# Teaching Rock Paper Scissors: Learning Through Doing

When we taught Rock Paper Scissors, the focus wasn’t just on the game itself — it was on showing CSSE students how to use **browser developer tools**, specifically the **Console**, to experiment with JavaScript in real time. The game became a fun hook, but the real lesson was understanding **fundamental programming concepts** like functions, conditional logic, and debugging. This project emphasized that coding isn’t just about writing lines of code — it’s about thinking logically, testing ideas, and solving problems step by step.

We introduced the basics:

* How to open and navigate the **browser Console**
* Executing JavaScript functions like `playRPS("rock")`
* Understanding game logic and conditional statements through live examples
* Extension challenges for students who wanted to explore further

Using Rock Paper Scissors as an example, students could *play with the code*, try different inputs, and immediately see the results. This hands-on approach made abstract concepts tangible — students weren’t just learning theory, they were **actively experimenting**. Watching the code respond in real time helped them grasp fundamental programming ideas more concretely.

During the lessons, we also helped a few students troubleshoot technical issues, especially when some of the girls had trouble running the code or interpreting Console outputs. Guiding them through these challenges was rewarding and reinforced our own understanding. It was exciting to see them gain confidence and begin to experiment independently.

Reflecting on this experience, teaching this way reminded us why interactive learning is so powerful. We enjoyed seeing students’ curiosity grow, and we ourselves had fun designing the lesson plan, anticipating where students might struggle, and providing support as they explored. Rock Paper Scissors may be a simple game, but the lesson was a **fundamental exercise in computational thinking, problem solving, and learning by doing**.
